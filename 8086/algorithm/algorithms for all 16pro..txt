Print all elements and sum of values > 40

Start with the array.

Loop through each element.

Print each element.

If element > 40, add it to sum.

After loop, print sum.

Problem 2

Print all elements and all even numbers

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If element is even, print it again as part of "even numbers".

Problem 3

Print all elements and all odd numbers

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If element is odd, print it again as part of "odd numbers".

Problem 4

Print all elements and sum of even numbers

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If even, add to sum.

Print sum.

Problem 5

Print all elements and sum of odd numbers

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If odd, add to sum.

Print sum.

Problem 6

Print all elements and sum of first even + last even

Loop through array.

Find first even, save it.

Find last even, save it.

Add them → sum.

Print elements and then sum.

Problem 7

Print all elements and maximum value

Assume first element is max.

Loop through array.

If element > max, update max.

Print all elements.

Print max.

Problem 8

Print all elements and minimum value

Assume first element is min.

Loop through array.

If element < min, update min.

Print all elements.

Print min.

Problem 9

Print all elements and values > 20

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If element > 20, print again as part of "greater than 20".

Problem 10

Print all elements and values < 20

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If element < 20, print again as part of "less than 20".

Problem 11

Print all elements and sum of odd numbers < 30

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If odd AND < 30, add to sum.

Print sum.

Problem 12

Print all elements and sum of even numbers < 25

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If even AND < 25, add to sum.

Print sum.

Problem 13

Print all elements and sum of min + max

Find min and max using loops.

Add them.

Print all elements.

Print the sum.

Problem 14

Print all elements and (sum of all elements − first element)

Loop through array.

Add all elements → sum.

Subtract first element.

Print elements.

Print result.

Problem 15

Print all elements and numbers < 10

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If element < 10, print again as "less than 10".

Problem 16

Print all elements and numbers between 20 and 30

Loop through array.

Print each element.

If 20 < element < 30, print it again as "between 20 and 30".
